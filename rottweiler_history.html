      <h1>Rottweiler History: From Working Dog to Sporting, Therapy Dog</h1>
      <p>
        People stop and stare when a Rottweiler appears on the scene. This
        medium to large working dog has striking coloring (black with brown
        markings ranging from rust to mahogany) and a muscular frame. Loyal,
        intelligent, and courageous, the breed gives off an air of nobility and
        self-confidence. In fact, the Rottweiler’s versatility has attracted
        people for millennia.

      <h2>The Rottweiler’s Roots</h2>

      <p>
        The Rottweiler we know today descends from mastiffs that lived in the
        Roman Empire more than 2,000 years ago. These rugged dogs accompanied
        Roman legions north through the Alps, since these soldiers were on their
        way to invade what’s now Switzerland. Along the way, ancestors of the
        Rottweiler helped move cattle that was intended to be eaten or
        eventually sold, and kept the livestock safe from predators and thieves.
        The Romans frequently stopped in what is now Rottweil, Germany, a
        significant center for livestock trade in the south. The city gets its
        modern name from its red roof tiles, but in ancient times, it was known
        as Arae Flaviae. After the Roman Empire collapsed, Rottweilers became
        valuable working companions in this part of Germany. They herded
        livestock in butchers’ yards, and would pull heavy carts full of meat to
        market. After the sale, a “drover,” someone who moves livestock, often
        placed the money in a purse around the dog’s neck. One look at this
        proud, protective breed might have made potential robbers think twice.
        Soon, the dog became known as the “Rottweiler Metzgerhund,” or
        “Butcher’s Dog of Rottweil.” Over the centuries, the breed was crossed
        with other developing breeds, such as the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog,
        the Bernese Mountain Dog, the Entlebucher Mountain Dog, and the
        Appenzeller Sennenhund.
